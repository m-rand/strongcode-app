The programming is quite simple: just keep the volume at the same levels and try to increase weight on the bar. As one becomes more advanced, progress increasingly depends on the volume and its proper distribution across sessions, weeks, months, and even years. The more advanced you are, the more complex programming is needed. And this is where StrongCode plays its role."
